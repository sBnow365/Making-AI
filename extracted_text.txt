AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) is a description language used in the development of natural language

software agents like chatbots and virtual assistants. AIML was developed by Richard Wallace from 1995 to 2000, and it is

based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language). AIML provides automated responses to users' questions because it is rule-

based. The scripting language represents a data-driven programming paradigm. While writing the script for a

conversational chatbot, all the conditions (the user's query) and actions (the chatbot's response) must be included.

Features of AIML

¢ data-driven: The user's queries are predefined as conditions and mapped with particular actions for generating automated responses for users.

* Rule-based Scripting language: If the conditions get satisfied, it performs an action based on the rule; if the condition does not get satisfied, then it stops.

* XML-based: AIML is easy to learn for programmers who know HTML or XML because it has a similar syntax to HTML and XML. It enables integration with XML editors using XML syntax.

* Flexibility: Customized tags and functions can be created for efficient code writing in development.
